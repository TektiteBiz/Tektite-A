This is the source code for the Tektite-A flight computer, which uses a custom PCB running a 600Hz sensor fusion and model predicitive control loop! Read more about it in [my blog post](https://medium.com/@vikramaditya.nishant/how-my-actively-controlled-arc-rocket-works-9e16d8917321).

And watch it fly on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/Xwev1y7XRM0?si=GzDy9w7g4ceLS_2h)!
